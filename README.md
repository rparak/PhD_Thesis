# Abstract

The significance of robot manipulators in engineering applications and scientific research has increased substantially in recent years. This surge can be attributed to the increased use of technologies such as autonomous robotics, digital twins, complex system integration, etc., along with the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques. The limitation in the use of these technologies may be associated with a focus on a specific type of robotic manipulator and a particular solved task, hindering modularity and reproducibility in future expansions.

This dissertation focuses on the design and development of advanced methods in industrial robotics that are closely related to the principles of Industry 4.0. It encompasses the development of comprehensive kinematic solutions and motion planning strategies for various robotic manipulators, including under-articulated, articulated, and over-articulated structures. To ensure computational efficiency, a collision avoidance structure is designed to prevent collisions with external objects or self-collision. Within the area of motion planning, a key research objective involves exploring innovative methods using reinforcement learning. Another significant research objective relates to the design of a versatile robotic workstation in accordance with the Industry 4.0 concept. This entails incorporating vertical system integration for seamless interoperability and optimal interconnection of diverse systems within the workstation. The dissertation objective also includes the design of a sophisticated user interface and a unique simulation tool based on Unity3D. A critical aspect of this dissertation focuses on versatility, education, and future expansion. The purpose of this dissertation is to contribute not only to the advancement of industrial robotics but also to its application in educational settings.
